# Tiny example for project work in data structures and algorithms

Note that the scope and documentation of this project is not appropriate for an actual data structures and algorithms project. This is intended to provide a primer into unit and performance testing with java (and gradle). Additionally there may be some general notes about code and project structure.

## [Basic data structure testing](src/test/java/rmq/domain)

## [Introduction to dependency injection](src/test/java/rmq/ui)

## [Performance testing](src/main/java/rmq/util)
